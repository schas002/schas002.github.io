Hi, I'm **Andrew Zyabin**, a **something-maker** from **Russia**. This is my GitHub Pages page.

- I'm on **[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org)**, at **[@ `zyabin101` @ `botsin` . `space`](https://botsin.space/@zyabin101)** and a few other instances.
	- However, the Mastodon *software* does not want me here (while the Mastodon *community* does).

- I have a **[blog](/blog)**, which got no updates in a year I guess.
